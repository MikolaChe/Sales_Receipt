# Sales_Receipt
A program for printing a sales receipt when buying in a store (a training project in Kotlin)
At first I did it based on array. But in this case I found that it will easyer with just String variable, and because of that I replace array with String line. 
At realy case I see it can be easy made with XML-file, or SQLite. In this work I just wanted to make the simpliest code.
